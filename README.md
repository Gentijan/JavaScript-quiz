## Credits
-   I give credit to a youtuber named Brian, I did copy his html code beacuse I wanted to have the same class and id just incase I got stuck on javaScript code. I did have some problems with end.js where Brians video helped me get through. But other than that I mostly did it on my own  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4fB9Xg2JEY)
